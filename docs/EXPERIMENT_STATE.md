# DVGC Experiment State

- Current HEAD lineage: controller `af5ed79`; terrain-clearance repair
  `6f32933`; constrained Flight diversification `1256728`.
- Runtime gate: PASS/current; config `05993a9...a91b9`; XML
  `d7e9f43...ce794c`.
- Landing policy: `landing-20260714-190401`, params `fa3a518b...34bb7e`.
- Landing candidates: `9784649...099505`; 96/96 eligible, 0 duplicates,
  one-step failure 0, 25-step physical failure 2/96, timeout 0.
- Landing Tube: `landing-98ee7a10f7`, `6f6b2ac...61ce8`; labels
  safe/boundary/dead/unknown = 79/12/4/1.
- Landing audit: 96 states, 1536 branches; Final=Chain=87.17%, physical
  failure=12.83%, timeout=horizon=0; precision/recall/coverage=98.73/96.30/
  82.29%, Brier=0.00888, ECE=0.06843. PASS; one held-out false-safe retained.
- Confirmed fixes: `9caaf23` chunked audit, `3421c47` bounded Warp replay gate.
- Flight augmented bank: `2d5d7de...f62934`; 83 fixed reference anchors plus
  77 constrained local candidates. Automatic ascent/apex/descent quotas and
  counts are 63/20/77. Build used 178/3000 proposals, 58 unique parents,
  maximum two children/parent; normalized NN min/p50/p95/max =
  0.1546/0.2807/1.3375/3.5079 at threshold 0.15. Rejections: joint range 74,
  normalized duplicate 26, pitch 1.
- Candidate gate: PASS. Overall and anchor/augmented grouped audits have
  contact=deep penetration=25-step physical failure=timeout=nonfinite=0;
  all 160 are finite/eligible/Flight-semantic and provenance-current.
  Anchor correction min/p50/p95/max=0/0.01236/0.15800/0.19023 m; augmented=
  0/0/0.00256/0.03318 m.
- Flight pilot: `runs/flight/pipeline_seed0_v5/pilot`, policy
  `flight-20260715-124908`, seed 0, 102400 effective steps. Healthy runtime,
  no NaN/OOM/compile restart; throughput 7.5k--11.3k SPS after compile.
  Fixed evaluation: Final=7.5%, Chain=0, physical failure=92.5%, timeout=0;
  pitch/roll/recovery=101/47/12. Anchor Final=6.02%, augmented=9.09%.
  Ascent/apex Final=0 in both groups; descent=15.58% overall.
- Frozen Landing-policy baseline on the same bank: Final=1.875%, Chain=0,
  physical failure=98.125%, timeout=0. Pilot improves Final fourfold and mean
  steps 20.82->25.30, but evaluation oscillates at 3.1--11.7% and misses the
  50% pilot gate. Value loss converged to 0.137, KL to 0.0131, policy std
  remained 0.0502; reset mix is 90% candidates/10% downstream rehearsal.
- Pause reason: candidate support is valid, but the first healthy Flight pilot
  does not establish ascent/apex learning. Choosing between a longer same-reset
  continuation and an intra-Flight backward reset curriculum affects the core
  training interpretation; no formal PPO/certification was started.
